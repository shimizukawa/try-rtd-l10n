msgid "A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the documentation, or build coverage information."

#: ../../sphinx/doc/glossary.rst:23

msgid "document name"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/glossary.rst:38
msgid "Since reST source files can have different extensions (some people like ``.txt``, some like ``.rst`` -- the extension can be configured with :confval:`source_suffix`) and different OSes have different path separators, Sphinx abstracts them: :dfn:`document names` are always relative to the :term:`source directory`, the extension is stripped, and path separators are converted to slashes.  All values, parameters and such referring to \"documents\" expect such document names."

msgid "A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\\ s and :term:`role`\\ s) to describe and link to :term:`object`\\ s belonging together, e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role names in a domain have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/glossary.rst:56
msgid "Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also means that extensions that support the documentation of whole new languages are much easier to write.  For more information about domains, see the chapter :ref:`domains`."
