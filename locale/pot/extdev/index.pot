msgid "This is what you can do in an extension: First, you can add new :term:`builder`\\s to support new output formats or actions on the parsed documents.  Then, it is possible to register custom reStructuredText roles and directives, extending the markup.  And finally, there are so-called \"hook points\" at strategic places throughout the build process, where an extension can register a hook and run specialized code."

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:16
msgid "An extension is simply a Python module.  When an extension is loaded, Sphinx imports this module and executes its ``setup()`` function, which in turn notifies Sphinx of everything the extension offers -- see the extension tutorial for examples."

msgid "The configuration file itself can be treated as an extension if it contains a ``setup()`` function.  All other extensions to load must be listed in the :confval:`extensions` configuration value."

msgid ":term:`Builder` extensions can be discovered by means of `entry points`_ so that they do not have to be listed in the :confval:`extensions` configuration value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:34
msgid "Builder extensions should define an entry point in the ``sphinx.builders`` group. The name of the entry point needs to match your builder's :attr:`~.Builder.name` attribute, which is the name passed to the :option:`sphinx-build -b` option. The entry point value should equal the dotted name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an entry point for 'mybuilder' can be defined in the extension's ``setup.py``::"

msgid "``'version'``: a string that identifies the extension version.  It is used for extension version requirement checking (see :confval:`needs_extensions`) and informational purposes.  If not given, ``\"unknown version\"`` is substituted."
