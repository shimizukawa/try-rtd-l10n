msgid "This is the documentation for the Sphinx documentation builder.  Sphinx is a tool that translates a set of reStructuredText_ source files into various output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices etc.  That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reST-formatted documents (and possibly subdirectories of docs in there as well), Sphinx can generate a nicely-organized arrangement of HTML files (in some other directory) for easy browsing and navigation.  But from the same source, it can also generate a PDF file using LaTeX, `rinohtype`_ or `rst2pdf`_ (see :ref:`builders`)."

#: ../../sphinx/doc/intro.rst:13
msgid "The focus is on hand-written documentation, rather than auto-generated API docs. Though there is support for that kind of documentation as well (which is intended to be freely mixed with hand-written content), if you need pure API docs have a look at `Epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_, which also understands reST."

msgid "For converting the old Python docs to Sphinx, a converter was written which can be found at `the Python SVN repository <http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools/converter>`_.  It contains generic code to convert Python-doc-style LaTeX markup to Sphinx reST."

msgid "Sphinx needs at least **Python 2.7** or **Python 3.4** to run, as well as the docutils_ and Jinja2_ libraries.  Sphinx should work with docutils version 0.10 or some (not broken) SVN trunk snapshot.  If you like to have source code highlighting support, you must also install the Pygments_ library."
