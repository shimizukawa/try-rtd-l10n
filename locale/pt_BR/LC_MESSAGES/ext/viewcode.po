"This extension looks at your Python object descriptions (``.. class::``, "
"``.. function::`` etc.) and tries to find the source files where the objects"
" are contained.  When found, a separate HTML page will be output for each "
"module with a highlighted version of the source code, and a link will be "
"added to all object descriptions that leads to the source code of the "
"described object.  A link back from the source to the description will also "
"be inserted."
