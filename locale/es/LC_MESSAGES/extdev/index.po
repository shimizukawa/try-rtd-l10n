"This is what you can do in an extension: First, you can add new "
":term:`builder`\\s to support new output formats or actions on the parsed "
"documents.  Then, it is possible to register custom reStructuredText roles "
"and directives, extending the markup.  And finally, there are so-called "
"\"hook points\" at strategic places throughout the build process, where an "
"extension can register a hook and run specialized code."

"An extension is simply a Python module.  When an extension is loaded, Sphinx"
" imports this module and executes its ``setup()`` function, which in turn "
"notifies Sphinx of everything the extension offers -- see the extension "
"tutorial for examples."

"The configuration file itself can be treated as an extension if it contains "
"a ``setup()`` function.  All other extensions to load must be listed in the "

"Builder extensions should define an entry point in the ``sphinx.builders`` "
"group. The name of the entry point needs to match your builder's "
":attr:`~.Builder.name` attribute, which is the name passed to the :option"
":`sphinx-build -b` option. The entry point value should equal the dotted "
"name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an entry point for "
"'mybuilder' can be defined in the extension's ``setup.py``::"
