# sphinx-doc.org on the Read The Docs.

This is a project to provide Sphinx official documentation with multiple versions and multiple languages on Read The Docs site.

Current procedure is bit tricky because Read The Docs doesn't have a way to specify options for sphinx-build command.
conf.py files for each languages have 'language' and 'locale_dirs' values without having full copy of conf.py of sphinx doc. If we want to specify conf.py file that is out of source directory, we will use '-c' option for sphinx-build command. Unfortunately Read the Docs can't. If there are any better way, please let me know.

## How to setup a translated documentation project on RTD

Detail is here: https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/localization.html#project-with-multiple-translations

Points are:

* We must have RTD projects for each languages.
* Each projects must have correct Language setting on "Settings" page.
* Master project has connections to each translated projects on "translations settings" page.

```
sh ./locale/update.sh
```

After that, you should commit updated po files.

   + rm -R es ja pt_BR
   + tx pull -l es,ja,pt_BR
   ```

2. update po files

## How to add a new version
